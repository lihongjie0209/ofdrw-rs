Unreleased source changes after v0.1.0:

- PDF sampled shading functions now support cubic (Order 3) interpolation,
  including table edges, interior extrema, reversed mappings and output clipping.
  Axial and radial import fixtures exercise the C ABI through Python, Go and
  Node.js; the axial pixel regression uses an independent Ghostscript render.
- macOS Python wheel tags identify the bundled library architecture. The v0.1.0
  GitHub wheel assets have also been corrected without changing native code.

These source changes do not alter the immutable v0.1.0 npm package or Git tags.

Initial public preview of ofdrw-rs.

- Rust OFD package/document core with shared C ABI.
- Python, Go and Node.js bindings, including TypeScript declarations.
- Supported page editing, layout, SVG/PNG/PDF export and PDF import.
- Supported annotations, attachments, signatures and encryption.
- Six native targets: Linux, macOS and Windows on x64 and ARM64.

Python is published on PyPI as `ofdrw-rs`, Node.js on npm as `ofdrw-rs`,
and the Rust core on crates.io as `ofdrw`. Go uses the GitHub module tag.
Install instructions are in the repository README. Wheels and the npm tarball
bundle their native library. Go consumers download the matching native ZIP
and set OFDRW_LIB_PATH. Rust consumers can use the Git tag or the .crate asset.

This is a preview with incomplete Java OFDRW/standards coverage. See
docs/FEATURES.md for supported behavior and remaining limitations.
